                    A team sport includes any sport where individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win or cooperate to entertain their audience. 
                    Team members act together towards a shared objective. This can be done in a number of ways such as outscoring the opposing team. 
                    Team members set goals, make decisions, communicate, manage conflict, and solve problems in a supportive, trusting atmosphere 
                    in order to accomplish their objectives. Examples are basketball, volleyball, rugby, water polo, handball, lacrosse,
                     cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football, and hockey. Team sports require internal coordination between members of the team in order to achieve success.
